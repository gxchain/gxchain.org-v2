GXChain理事会和公信节点</h4>\n<p>在 GXChain 的治理生态中有如下三个角色:</p>\n<p>1) 持币者：持有任意数量GXC的个体或机构。</p>\n<p>2) 公信节点: 由全体GXC持币者投票选举出的个体或机构，每1小时统计一次投票，共有21个公信节点。21个节点由投票前20名节点以及一个随机节点构成。 公信节点负责GXChain网络的交易验证、交易记账、区块打包和确认等工作，成功打包区块将获得对应的奖励。公信节点接受GXChain社区的监督。</p>\n<p>3) GXChain理事会: 公信节点按得票数的前11名当选为GXChain理事会成员。</p>\n<p>GXChain理事会是GXChain社区的核心链上治理组织，主要职责是设定合理的公链全局参数，以此促进GXChain长期的健康发展。其中包括：</p>\n<ul class=\"ti-2\">\n\t<li>1) 修改区块链的动态参数，比如区块大小、区块间隔等；</li>\n\t<li>2) 公信节点出块奖励、公信节点数量和活跃理事会成员数量等；</li>\n\t<li>3) 转账、发行资产及各类交易手续费；</li>\n\t<li>4) 智能合约的创建和调用费率等。</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2. 公信节点竞选规则</h4>\n<p class=\"ti-2\">\n\t每一位GXC持币者都可成为公信节点的竞选者。竞选者需要向系统抵押1万GXC(具体金额由理事会投票决定)，退出竞选时可在30天后(系统动态参数，可由理事会投票调整)取回。若节点作恶，其抵押的GXC可由理事会投票处理。为了保障节点竞选的高效进行， GXChain针对公信节点候选人制定了一系列的标准和规则。由GXChain基金会的生态建设委员会(GXChain-ECO)根据标准和规则对候选节点进行审核。公信节点候选人必须符合以下基本条件：\n</p>\n<ul class=\"ti-2\">\n\t<li>1) 具有合法设立的组织主体，且拥有官网及社交账号；</li>\n\t<li>2) 具有可供社区成员测试的节点；</li>\n\t<li>3) 拥有可运行节点的服务器和节点运维技术；</li>\n\t<li>4) 创建公信节点，需要抵押一定数量的GXC，若取回抵押的GXC，则视为退出竞选;</li>\n\t<li>5) 已制定未来三年的预算支持，技术方案，硬件扩容以及社区支持计划；</li>\n\t<li>6) 拥有一定规模的社区用户。</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.3. 节点收益</h4>\n<p class=\"ti-2\">\n\t公信节点的收益主要来自出块奖励，由理事会投票决定出块奖励金额。在每一次区块打包完成之后，公信节点将获得相应的出块奖励。出块奖励池子由转账手续费以及基金会捐赠节点奖励两部分构成。为激励公信节点在GXChain生态中做出的积极贡献，GXChain基金会将捐赠400万枚GXC注入系统资金池作为节点出块奖励，奖励分8年发放，每年释放50万枚。\n</p>\n<h4>2.4. 公信节点投票产生方式</h4>\n<p class=\"ti-2\">\n\t每一个GXC视为一票，可为多个候选节点投票。参与公信节点投票的GXC将被质押在自己的钱包，如果资产转出，则视为撤票。累计票数排名前20名节点自动当选为公信节点，第21个节点从剩余的备选节点中随机产生。 投票途径主要有3种：\n</p>\n<ul class=\"ti-2\">\n\t<li>1)布洛克城投票</li>\n\t<li>在布洛克城钱包中的GXC，可通过布洛克城的投票通道进行公信节点的投票。</li>\n\t<li>2)手机钱包和PC钱包投票</li>\n\t<li>在GXChain手机钱包和PC钱包中的GXC可进行公信节点的投票。</li>\n\t<li>3) 交易所投票</li>\n\t<li>如果用户的GXC在交易所钱包里，且该交易所支持GXChain的公信节点投票，便可以采用此方式进行投票。</li>\n</ul>",
